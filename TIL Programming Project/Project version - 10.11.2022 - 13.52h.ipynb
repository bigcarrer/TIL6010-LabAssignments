    "Britain Exit or generally known as Brexit refers to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), which happened on 31st January 2020 at 23:00 GMT. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exit from the EU had tremendous consequences for the UK in terms of the trade of goods, among other aspects. Such a consequence was the \"steep decline\" in the number of trading relationships Britain has with the EU block. This was a particularly serious consequence for smaller companies, as they struggled to absorb custom controls, VAT and regulatory red tape. In other words - smaller firms did not have the money, time or logistical capacity to set up within the EU, and were therefore hit the hardest. Moreover, it even appeared that after 2021, the UK just stopped selling a lot of porducts to smaller countries in the EU (https://www.ft.com/content/b0860ee6-e06e-4fc4-bd87-d56dcc7ee946).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the exports from UK to the EU declined by nearly 14% in 2021, compared with 2020 (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/30/brexit-uk-exports-fall-eu-goods-services#:~:text=The%20UK's%20decision%20to%20choose,%E2%80%93%20a%20drop%20of%2013.6%25). The count of UK exporters and importers also started declining after 2020 (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1033099/IDBR_OTS_2020.pdf).\n",

    "However, at the same time when the Brexit was issued, the Covid-19 virus was speading fast worldwide. It affected every part of \"normal life\", including the trade of goods internationally. And since Brexit and Covid-19 were happening alsmost simultaneously, analysing the change of trade before and after Brexit might have a bias due to the influence of Covid-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is important to determine whether there is any difference in international trade due to Brexit and Covid-19. The difference is analysed by taking the average of the world's international trade percentage and comparing it with UK's trade percentage. Such approach is chosen because Covid-19 has affected the whole world while Brexit has mainly affect UK's trade. If there is any difference observed, it can be concluded that Brexit has influence in the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, since there are many transport modes, a choice about the direction of the research had to be made in order to make it more specific. The trade of goods by railway was selected, as railway transportation is the \"backbone\" of the British economy, as it employs around 240 000 people, and it moves over 85 million tonnes of freight each year, thus spreading wealth to each part of the country. Moreover, railway is the only physical link between the UK and Europe, thus providing a smoother flow of goods between the UK and the EU, which flow is critical for the transport secctor (https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/about-us/publications/archive/125-2018-03-brexit-policy-asks/file.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second transportation mode chosen for this research was the maritime transportation, as it posseses physical properties, such as buoyancy and limited friction, thus making it the most effective mode of moving large quantities of cargo over long distances, worldwide (https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter5/transportation-modes-modal-competition-modal-shift/#:~:text=Maritime%20transportation,of%20cargo%20over%20long%20distances).Moreover, this mode was chosen, as at the end of 2020 not only the third pandemix wave was starting, but also the Brexit-deal was announced last-minute, meaning that borders closed just days before Christmas. All of this caused unforseen chaos and uncertainty for many industries, including the maritime goods transportation industry (https://www.container-xchange.com/blog/shipping-brexit-and-covid-19/#the_future_of_the_shipping_industry_in_the_uk_and_europe).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the aforementioned reasons, we decided that it would be interesting to research what effect Brexit specifically had on the railway and maritime goods transportation industries. And as Brexit and Covid-19 were happening simultaneously, it is important to note that in this research, we are trying to isolate the effects oof Covid-19 and get to the bottom of the actual effects Brexit alone had on the two industries."
